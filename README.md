# tensura-fonts

A repository containing the fonts that were created based on a series named "Tensei Shitara Slime Datta Ken" or in short "Tensura". All fonts are self-made, while the gylphs they were based on came from the manga and anime, hence they're not completely original.

All of these fonts are free for everyone to use and not intended for being sold or other commercial purposes.
