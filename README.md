# tensura-fonts

A repository containing the fonts that were created based on the most prominent writing system used in the world of "Tensei Shitara Slime Datta Ken" or in short "Tensura". 

All fonts are self-created. The manga and anime fully belong to their rightful owners, hence the fonts are not completely original. Only the fonts that are self-created but the glyphs they were based on came directly from the manga and anime. Please note that these fonts do NOT cover EVERYTHING, but they are guaranteed to at least cover all English-equivalent letters (both uppercase and lowercase), numbers, and a few number of basic punctuations.

All of these fonts are free for everyone to use and not intended for being sold or other commercial purposes.
