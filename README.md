# tensura-fonts

A repository containing the fonts that were created based on a series named "Tensei Shitara Slime Datta Ken" or in short "Tensura". All fonts are self-created. The manga and anime fully belong to their rightful owners, hence the fonts are not completely original. Only the fonts that are self-created but the glyphs they were based on came directly from the manga and anime.

All of these fonts are free for everyone to use and not intended for being sold or other commercial purposes.
